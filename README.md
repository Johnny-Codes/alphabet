# alphabet
Typing/alphabet game with a little bit of math

What I learned:

This was my attempt at a first project without researching answers. For the most part, I didn't, just needed a reminder of the import random and code that goes with it.

Lots of practice with Try/Exception. Really the only thing I had to look up and play with so that typing strings as an answer in the math excercises wouldn't break with the ValueError.

To do:

I really want to put this in a GUI as this was an exercise for me, but also a game for teaching my young kiddo. I think a good looking GUI will keep her interest more than looking at PowerShell. Leaning towards using wxPython.

Hopefully I can keep this evolving as she gets older, adding dictionaries for word games, bigger numbers and adding multiplication and division.
